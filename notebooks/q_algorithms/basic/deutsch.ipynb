    "Imagine we have a function $f: \\{0, 1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$. This function can also be thought of as a  <strong>Quantum Oracle</strong>. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **oracle** is a \"black-box\" function that we can query to retrieve information about a mathematical problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong> Quantum Oracle </strong> is the quantum equivalent of a classical oracle:\n",
    "- It can be described as a quantum operator $U_f$ that acts upon a two-qubit system:\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x, y} = \\ket{x, y \\oplus f(x)}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know anything about this function, and cannot pry into its inner workings. We can however, send in a bit and read the output. Our task is to determine wether the function is **constant** or **balanced**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **constant** function, the output is the same no matter the input. (Constant 1 or constant 0)\n",
    "- In a **balanced** function, the function returns 1s and 0s in equal quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Classical Computers: </strong> need 2 queries of the function to determine if $f(0) = f(1) $. It needs to calculate both $f(0)$ and $f(1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong> A Quantum Computer </strong>using Deutsch's algorithm, can determine $f$ with just <strong> one query </strong> to the quantum oracle, by exploiting superposition and interference. It thus possesses a <strong>Quantum Advantage</strong>.\n"
